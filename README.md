# Classification App With Python
 

 - [ ] Don't forget to adjust the settings in the "config.json" file before running the application!
       
 - [ ] If you are using an insufficient dataset, you can augment your data set by running the "augmentation.py" file (the data set path is specified in the main.py file).

 - [ ] You can test the model you trained with the "classification.py" file. (When testing, make sure the "data_path_main" location in the "config.json" file is the same location you used when you trained your model!)
